# Docker Local Deployment Guide

## Issues Fixed

1. **TypeScript Version Mismatch**: Angular 16 requires TypeScript `>=4.9.3 and <5.2.0`, but was using `^5.1.3` which could resolve to 5.9.3
   - Fixed: Changed to `~5.1.6` for strict version control

2. **Node Version Compatibility**: Updated Docker images from node:20 to node:18 for better compatibility

3. **Build Dependencies**: Fixed Dockerfile to include dev dependencies during build

## Local Deployment with Docker

### Prerequisites
- Docker Desktop installed and running
- Git repository cloned locally

### Option 1: Development Mode (Hot Reload)

```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd c:\Users\basha\Desktop\omni-scholar

# Build and run development container
docker-compose up --build

# Application will be available at: http://localhost:4200
```

**Features:**
- Hot reload on file changes
- Full source code visibility
- Slower initial build (~2-3 minutes)

### Option 2: Production Build (Optimized)

```bash
# Build the production image
docker build -t omni-scholar:latest .

# Run the production container
docker run -p 80:80 omni-scholar:latest

# Application will be available at: http://localhost
```

**Features:**
- Optimized production build
- Nginx serving static files
- Smaller image size
- Faster startup

### Verify Deployment

1. **Check Container Status**
   ```bash
   docker ps
   ```

2. **View Logs**
   ```bash
   # For development
   docker-compose logs -f

   # For production
   docker logs <container_id> -f
   ```

3. **Access Application**
   - Development: http://localhost:4200
   - Production: http://localhost

4. **Check Console for Errors**
   - Open browser DevTools (F12)
   - Check Console tab for any JavaScript errors

### Troubleshooting

**Build Fails with TypeScript Error**
- Ensure package.json has `typescript: ~5.1.6`
- Run `npm install` locally to verify dependencies

**Port Already in Use**
- Development: Change port in docker-compose.yml (e.g., 4201:4200)
- Production: Change port in docker run command (e.g., 8080:80)

**Container Exits Immediately**
- Check logs: `docker logs <container_id>`
- Verify all source files are present
- Ensure package.json is valid

### Clean Up

```bash
# Stop all containers
docker-compose down

# Remove all containers and images
docker system prune -a

# Remove specific image
docker rmi omni-scholar:latest
```

## Next Steps

1. Test locally with Docker to verify all errors are resolved
2. Once working locally, redeploy to Vercel
3. Monitor Vercel build logs for any remaining issues
