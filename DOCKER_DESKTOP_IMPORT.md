## 🐛 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Containers Won't Start
1. Make sure Docker Desktop is running
2. Check if ports are already in use
3. Try restarting Docker Desktop
4. Try importing again

### Can't Access Services
1. Check container status in Docker Desktop
2. Verify it shows "Running" (green circle)
3. Wait 30 seconds for services to fully start
4. Try refreshing the browser

### Import Button Not Visible
1. Make sure you're in the "Builds" tab
2. Look for "Import builds" button at top right
3. If not visible, click "Builds" again

### File Won't Import
1. Make sure file is named `.dockerbuild`
2. Make sure it's in the `backend/` folder
3. Try dragging the file into Docker Desktop window
4. Or copy the file path and paste it

## 💡 TIPS

1. **Keep Docker Desktop Open**: Leave it running while developing
2. **Check Logs**: Click on a container to see what's happening
3. **Restart Services**: Right-click container → "Restart"
4. **Stop Services**: Right-click container → "Stop"
5. **View Details**: Click on container name to see more info
