# Phase 1: Action Plan - Start Here! 🚀
## Infrastructure Setup - Your Next Steps

---

## ✅ WHAT'S READY

Your backend project is now initialized with:
- ✅ NestJS application structure
- ✅ Docker Compose with all services
- ✅ TypeScript configuration
- ✅ Environment setup
- ✅ Complete setup guide

**All files committed to GitHub** ✅

---

## 🎯 YOUR IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS

### Step 1: Open Terminal (5 minutes)
```bash
# Navigate to backend directory
cd c:\Users\basha\Desktop\omni-scholar\backend
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies (3-5 minutes)
```bash
npm install
```

**What this does**: Downloads all NestJS, TypeORM, and other dependencies

### Step 3: Start Infrastructure (2 minutes)
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

**What this does**: Starts PostgreSQL, Elasticsearch, Redis, Kafka, Prometheus, Grafana

### Step 4: Verify Everything Works (2 minutes)
```bash
# Test API
curl http://localhost:3000/api

# Should return:
# {
#   "message": "Welcome to OmniScholar API",
#   "version": "1.0.0",
#   "timestamp": "2025-10-27T..."
# }
```

### Step 5: Start Backend Server (1 minute)
```bash
npm run start:dev
```

**What this does**: Starts the backend server with hot reload

## 📊 WHAT YOU'LL HAVE RUNNING

After these steps, you'll have:

| Service | URL | Status |
|---------|-----|--------|
| Backend API | http://localhost:3000/api | ✅ Running |
| PostgreSQL | localhost:5432 | ✅ Running |
| Elasticsearch | http://localhost:9200 | ✅ Running |
| Redis | localhost:6379 | ✅ Running |
| Kafka | localhost:9092 | ✅ Running |
| Grafana | http://localhost:3001 | ✅ Running |
| Prometheus | http://localhost:9090 | ✅ Running |

---

## 🔍 VERIFY EACH SERVICE

### Test PostgreSQL
```bash
psql -h localhost -U scholar -d omni_scholar -c "SELECT 1"
# Should return: 1
```

### Test Elasticsearch
```bash
curl http://localhost:9200
# Should return JSON with cluster info
```

### Test Redis
```bash
redis-cli ping
# Should return: PONG
```

### Test Kafka
```bash
docker exec omni-scholar-kafka kafka-topics --list --bootstrap-server localhost:9092
# Should list topics (empty initially)
```

## 📝 TOTAL TIME ESTIMATE

| Task | Time |
|------|------|
| Navigate to backend | 1 min |
| Install dependencies | 3-5 min |
| Start Docker services | 2 min |
| Verify services | 2 min |
| Start backend server | 1 min |
| **TOTAL** | **9-12 min** |

## 🎓 WHAT HAPPENS NEXT

Once everything is running:

### Week 1-2: Database Setup
- Create Paper entity
- Create Author entity
- Create Citation entity
- Run migrations

### Week 2-3: Authentication
- Implement JWT strategy
- Create auth module
- Add user registration/login

### Week 3-4: Core APIs
- Build Papers API
- Build Search API
- Build Citations API

---

## 📚 HELPFUL RESOURCES

### Documentation
- **Setup Guide**: PHASE_1_SETUP_GUIDE.md (detailed)
- **Technical Guide**: TECHNICAL_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md (code examples)
- **Quick Reference**: QUICK_REFERENCE.md (commands)

### Useful Commands
```bash
# Stop all services
docker-compose down

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f

# Restart a service
docker-compose restart postgres

# View backend logs
npm run start:dev  # Already shows logs
```

---

## ⚠️ COMMON ISSUES & FIXES

### Port Already in Use
```bash
# If port 3000 is taken
PORT=3001 npm run start:dev
```

### Docker Won't Start
```bash
# Make sure Docker Desktop is running
# Then try again:
docker-compose up -d
```

### npm install Fails
```bash
# Clear cache and try again
npm cache clean --force
npm install
```

### Database Connection Error
```bash
# Wait a few seconds for PostgreSQL to start
# Then test:
psql -h localhost -U scholar -d omni_scholar -c "SELECT 1"
```

## 🚀 SUCCESS CHECKLIST

After completing all steps, you should have:

- [ ] Backend directory navigated to
- [ ] Dependencies installed (`npm install` completed)
- [ ] Docker services running (`docker-compose up -d`)
- [ ] API responding (`curl http://localhost:3000/api` works)
- [ ] PostgreSQL accessible
- [ ] Elasticsearch accessible
- [ ] Redis accessible
- [ ] Backend server running (`npm run start:dev`)
- [ ] No errors in logs
- [ ] Ready to create database entities

---

## 💡 TIPS

1. **Keep terminal open**: Leave `npm run start:dev` running in one terminal
2. **Use new terminal**: Open another terminal for running commands
3. **Check logs**: If something fails, check the logs first
4. **Docker Desktop**: Make sure it's running before starting services
5. **Patience**: First startup takes longer, subsequent ones are faster

---

## 📞 NEED HELP?

1. Check **PHASE_1_SETUP_GUIDE.md** for detailed troubleshooting
2. Review Docker logs: `docker-compose logs`
3. Verify all ports are available
4. Ensure Docker Desktop is running
5. Check environment variables in `.env`

---

## 🎯 GOAL

By the end of Phase 1:
- ✅ Backend infrastructure running
- ✅ All services operational
- ✅ Ready to build database layer
- ✅ Ready to create APIs

---

## 📋 NEXT PHASE PREVIEW

Once Phase 1 is complete, Phase 2 will focus on:
- Database entities (Paper, Author, Citation, User)
- Authentication system
- Core API endpoints
- Search functionality

---

## 🚀 LET'S GO!

You're ready to start building. Follow these steps in order:

1. Open terminal
2. `cd backend`
3. `npm install`
4. `docker-compose up -d`
