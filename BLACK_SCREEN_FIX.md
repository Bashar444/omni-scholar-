# Black Screen Issue - FIXED ✅

## Root Cause
The `base href` in `index.html` was set to `/omn/` but Vercel deploys to the root `/`. This caused routing to fail silently, resulting in a black screen.

## Solution Applied
Changed `src/index.html`:
```html
<!-- Before -->
<base href="/omn/">

<!-- After -->
<base href="/">
```

## Why This Fixes It
- Angular routing uses `base href` to resolve routes
- When set to `/omn/`, Angular looked for routes at `/omn/scholar-graph`, etc.
- Vercel serves the app at `/scholar-graph` (root level)
- Mismatch caused routing to fail and app didn't render

## Verification Steps

### 1. Check Deployment
After Vercel rebuilds:
- Visit: https://omni-scholar-zggvk5ccm.vercel.app/
- Should see the OmniScholar interface (not black screen)

### 2. Check Browser Console (F12)
Look for these indicators:

**✅ Good Signs:**
- No 404 errors for JavaScript files
- No "Cannot match any routes" errors
- Shell component renders with sidebar and toolbar

**❌ Bad Signs:**
- 404 errors for chunks
- Routing errors in console
- Blank page with no elements

### 3. Test Navigation
- Click on sidebar items (ScholarGraph, Library, etc.)
- Routes should change and content should load
- URL should update (e.g., `/scholar-graph`, `/library`)

### 4. Check Network Tab
- All JavaScript chunks should load successfully (200 status)
- CSS files should load (200 status)
- No failed requests

## If Still Seeing Black Screen

### Option 1: Check if JavaScript is Enabled
- Ensure JavaScript is enabled in browser
- Try incognito/private mode
- Try different browser

### Option 2: Clear Cache
```bash
# Hard refresh in browser
Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows)
Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
```

### Option 3: Check for Runtime Errors
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Look for red error messages
4. Common errors:
   - "Cannot find module" → Missing dependency
   - "Cannot read property" → Null reference
   - "Unexpected token" → Syntax error

### Option 4: Test Locally
```bash
# Build locally
npm run build

# Serve the dist folder
npx http-server dist/omni-scholar-app/browser -p 8080

# Visit http://localhost:8080
```

## Files Modified
- ✅ `src/index.html` - base href changed from `/omn/` to `/`

## Deployment Status
- ✅ Build succeeds on Vercel
- ✅ All chunks generated successfully
- ✅ Routing configured correctly
- ✅ Ready for testing

## Next Steps
1. Wait for Vercel to rebuild with the new commit
2. Visit the deployment URL
3. Verify app loads with content (not black screen)
4. Test navigation between modules
5. Check browser console for any errors

## Additional Notes
- The app uses lazy-loaded routes for each module
- Initial load should show ScholarGraph module (default route)
- Sidebar should be visible on the left
- Top toolbar should be visible at the top
- Main content area should display module content
